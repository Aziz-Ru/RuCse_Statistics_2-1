# Distribution:
_A distribution in statistics is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur. It is a mathematical description of the spread of the data._
## Variance:
_Variance is a measure of how spread out a set of data is from the mean_
## Expected value:
_Expected value is the average value of a random variable._ 
## population:
_In statistics, a population is a set of all similar items or events that are of interest for some question or experiment._
## sample:
_In statistics, a sample is a subset of a population._
## parameter:
_In statistics, a parameter is a numerical measure that describes characteristic a population.It is a characteristic of the entire population, not just a sample.Parameters are often denoted by Greek letters, such as μ for the population mean and σ2 for the population variance._
```
    Mean: The average value of all the members of the population.
    Median: The middle value of all the members of the population when arranged in order from least to greatest.
    Mode: The most frequent value of all the members of the population.
    Variance: A measure of how spread out the data is around the mean.
    Standard deviation: The square root of the variance.
```

## statistic:
_A statistic is a numerical measure that describes a sample. It is a characteristic of the sample,  not the population_
## estimator:    
_An estimator is a statistic that estimates some fact about the population._
## Simple random sampling:
_Simple random sampling (SRS) is a probability sampling method in which every member of a population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample._
## Example od Estimator
_Mean,Median,Mode,Varience,Standard Deviation_
```

There are three main criteria of a good estimator:
Unbiasedness: An unbiased estimator is one whose expected value is equal to the population parameter it is estimating. This means that, on average, the estimator will be equal to the population parameter.

    Consistency: A consistent estimator is one that converges to the population parameter as the sample size increases. This means that the estimator will become more and more accurate as the sample size increases.
    
    Efficiency: An efficient estimator is one that has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators of the same population parameter. This means that the estimator will be less variable than other estimators, which will lead to more accurate inferences.

## sample distribution:
_A sample distribution is the probability distribution of a statistic that is obtained  through repeated sampling of a specific population._
 ##  Normal distribution:    
 _Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data  near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from  the mean._

 ```
 x = value of the variable or data being examined and f(x) the probability function
 μ = the mean
 σ = the standard deviation
A normal distribution becomes a standard normal distribution when it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
