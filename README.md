# Distribution:
_A distribution in statistics is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur. It is a mathematical description of the spread of the data._
## Variance:
_Variance is a measure of how spread out a set of data is from the mean_
## Expected value:
_Expected value is the average value of a random variable._ 
## population:
_In statistics, a population is a set of all similar items or events that are of interest for some question or experiment._
## sample:
_In statistics, a sample is a subset of a population._
## parameter:
_In statistics, a parameter is a numerical measure that describes characteristic a population.It is a characteristic of the entire population, not just a sample.Parameters are often denoted by Greek letters, such as μ for the population mean and σ2 for the population variance._
```
    Mean: The average value of all the members of the population.
    Median: The middle value of all the members of the population when arranged in order from least to greatest.
    Mode: The most frequent value of all the members of the population.
    Variance: A measure of how spread out the data is around the mean.
    Standard deviation: The square root of the variance.
